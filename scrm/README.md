# Supply Chain Hack (version 0.1)

Supply Chain is a very broad topic with many facets of challenges. Each organization's supply chain is different, so its critical to understand the intricacies of each supply chain and its sub systems before recommending a solution.

It's impossible to cover every aspect of supply chain in a single hack or a single solution, so the tactical goal of this hack is to provide a high level introduction to supply chain risk management and some hands on approaches to solve them using both 1st party and 3rd party services.
